- 👋 Hi, I’m @sosik1985
- 👀 I’m interested in protecting personal information and data
- 🌱 I’m currently learning building a chassis data routers and learning the configurations of different telephone types specifically anti spy I have been hacked numerous times by the same person they're a little trick where they add a Sim card and I download something onto my phone and then my phone is under their command I have been sewing of identity social security cards bank accounts and my military pension I like to bring the justice justice one specific person cuz she knows about my personal life and a single military vet that struggles with one daughter that he raises
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on  isolating the incident and removing the threat... If any of my colleagues here are aware of a sweetlipsJen or a JenBorrelli please use caution I prefer to remain anonymous through whatever happens I love her she has done quite a few identity theft and I'm pretty sure she has a tail this is my first attempt to just try to get her off my tail but others are others that haven't been fortunate enough to even know how to do this so just be careful cuz you could be a mark from when I park I live in if I'm supposed to say this stuff so I'm sorry if I broke any rules but she is jumbled and that's a fact
- 📫 How to reach me timtomjim85@gmail.com however allow your introduction or your name to be something that's not pass obvious is GitHub because they may know that you guys were computer sophisticated and aware of any cyberstalking ...
